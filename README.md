###### To do

Error: Each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop.
- ~~add a key attribute to div~~

Authentication
 - ~~jwt needs to hang out somewhere stealthy and be handed on the dl to api~~
 - make sure logout is working

SignIn
- ~~Save user id to session storage for use when creating sequences~~

SequenceCreate
- Make SequenceCreate Component
- Use PoseSelect as a Component for SequenceCreate
- Need option to move selected poses up/down
- Need to post completed sequence
- Button for another PoseSelect dropdown
- Delete option for selected Pose

Sequences
 - User sequence list needs to display sequences by user (see new backend route :)
 - Delete sequence needs to exist and be an option on user sequence list or bottom of actual sequence w/ confirm
 
 Sequence
 - Needs to display actual sequence (was specific sequence by User + sequence id--just get by sequence id for now, assume correct user for mvp)
 - Delete sequence needs to exist


 sequenceService (by user)
 - ~~delete~~
 - ~~post (already have backend for this because sequence takes user)~~
 - ~~edit~~
 - ~~get all (by user, have backend)~~
 - ~~get one (get sequence by id)~~

 Styling
 - hi

Backend 
- ~~sequence schema: add user to~~
- ~~need to get sequences by user~~

 Later <3
 - Edit sequence (put)
 - Further Customize Sequence (intro, theme, guided meditation, pranayama, etc)
 - Chakra UI instead?
